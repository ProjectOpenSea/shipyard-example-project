 *         update the active signers of a zone. The sanitizer role can remove
 *         all  active signers of a zone controlled by the captain and clear
 *         the  rotator role on the captain.
 *         In order to ensure the captain is deployed by an approved deployer,
 *         the _assertValidDeployer function is overridden to check that the
 *         deployer is the address is valid.
